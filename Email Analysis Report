## 🚩 Phishing Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **❌ Suspicious Sender Email** | The email comes from `@careerbuildcompany.com`, which is **not** an official LinkedIn domain (e.g., `@linkedin.com`). |
| **⚠️ Generic Salutation** | The greeting says “Demo,” which could be either a placeholder or an error—indicative of automated phishing tools. |
| **❓ Link Masking** | The “See what’s new” button does not show the actual URL. This is a common phishing tactic to conceal malicious links. |
| **⚠️ Brand Imitation** | The layout and branding closely mimic LinkedIn’s notification design, but the domain mismatch breaks authenticity. |
| **❌ Unusual Domain** | LinkedIn would never use a third-party domain like `careerbuildcompany.com` for notifications. |
| **⚠️ Psychological Trigger** | The message shows “28 updates” to create curiosity and a false sense of urgency. |

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations

- Do **not click** any links or buttons from emails with suspicious sender domains.
- Hover over buttons and links to inspect actual URLs before clicking.
- Use official apps or log into LinkedIn directly via a browser, rather than through email links.
- Report suspicious emails to your IT/security team and block the sender domain if verified as malicious.
